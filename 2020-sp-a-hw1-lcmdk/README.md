# Files

You should only have a single file that is **_NOT_** code, it should be a basic list of steps written with proper grammar and spelling.

## Git help

Some of you may not be familiar with git still, so here are the basic steps:
*	Clone the repo using the "clone/download" and copy the link in the `HTTPS` box.
*	Create a `cs1570` folder in your SDRIVE if you don't have one already: `mkdir cs1570` and `cd cs1570` so you're inside the folder.
*	`git clone the-link-you-copied`
*	This should create a folder called `2020-SP-CS1570-hwX`. You can now `cd` into that folder.
*	Whenever you create a new file `git` will track your changes and you can add your file to the repo by doing `git add filename.ext`
*	Now we can "commit" our file! You need to add a message with your commit to briefly explain what your changes are. `git commit -m "I made a file with my name in it!"`. The message will show up in your git repo, so be careful of what you write.
*	Finally you can "push" your changes to the git repo! `git push`  is all you need to do, it'll ask you to login with your info so once you login you'll be done.
